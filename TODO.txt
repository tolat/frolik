BUGS:

- When modal is scrolled down and then hidden (changind user status e.g.) 
the baffle doesn;t come down with tho modal and the hidden modal is visible
FIXED

- Changing any profile fields other than picture doesn't stay (reverts after a second,
presumably when the post call to the server resolves)
FIXED

- When a new outing is created, it changes the usericon piecolor only on the
profile page

- two chats in chat modal on profile page sometimes, unsure of cause. seems to happen
onnly when having joined a chat from the notifications screen

- if a user joins an outing while other users are in chat, it crashes the app for those
other users. 

- user pictures for new outings just accepted don't load. 

- Matches don't update when a match goes from ready to busy and back
FIXED
